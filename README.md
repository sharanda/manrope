## Manrope V5 Coming Soon

Hey everyone,

Iâ€™m excited to announce that Iâ€™m working on Manrope V5, but this time, it will be closed source. When I first made it open source, I hoped for contributions, but instead, my font was misused and released under different names with no attribution. Itâ€™s been frustrating, and I no longer want to maintain it in that way.

V5 wonâ€™t be released on Google Fonts. While it could offer convenience for Figma and Google Slides, Iâ€™m not after popularity. I want to keep it rare, for the true fans of Manrope. Google also converts the font internally, causing bugs and rendering issues that I canâ€™t fix.

The new version will be available for download here, and Iâ€™ll be collecting feedback to improve it. You can follow the work in progress on Instagram at @mike.gentle.

Thanks for your understanding and continued support!
